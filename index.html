		<h3>Symmary</h3>
			<p class="symmary" align="right">My goal is to work in a large company, every day to learn something new and develop. Computer systems have always been my passion. Despite the fact that I work as a creative profession, I always wanted to work at a computer.</p>
		    <p class="symmary" align="right">I was always interested in how to create computer programs, games, websites. I have a lot of friends from IT, and when they talked about their work, for me it was something unreal, cool and unattainable.</p>
			<p class="symmary" align="right">But half a year ago I discovered "The Rolling Scopes School" courses. First I started to study independently. Studied HTML, CSS, the basics of Java Script. It's amazing! It is quite difficult, but also very interesting. Feel the creator! From the beginning of the courses I learned more new and interesting information than in the past two years. And I like it! I want to continue studying JS, writing code, committing, pushing, forking and doing a bunch of other things, the names of which six months ago I did not even know. Yes, I have little experience, but I am ready to work around the clock to become a worthy member of the your team!</p>
